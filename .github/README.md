## About Oxocarbon

Oxocarbon is a port for IntelliJ Based IDE's based on Nyoom's Oxocarbon implementation for Neovim which you can find [here](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/nyoom.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file).

The theme is in my opinion what true dark themes should be, the dark ui layout paired with a beautifully crafted color-scheme, makes sure that your focus is where it actually matters and thats your code. 
I've tried to organize the colors in such a way that make the IDE both pleasing to look at, while still offering all the relative information that the user would need. Although I'm not a UI expert, thats how I felt while looking
at the end design.

## How to use

Although there is no other way to use the theme besides plug and play. I'd highly recommend using the [SF Liga Mono Nerd Font](https://github.com/shaunsingh/SFMono-Nerd-Font-Ligaturized). I wasn't able to ship the font with the color scheme
because it kept causing issues. When you change the font to my recommended font, please make sure to set the Typography settings to the following`

To change typography settings navigate to` 

<kbd>Settings</kbd> **>** <kbd>Editor</kbd> **>** <kbd>Font</kbd> **>** <kbd>Typography Settings</kbd>

Otherwise your font will not look as readable as it should.

## What to expect in the near future.

- Customization Options
- More Color Schemes
- Custom Icons

And hopefully much more, I just haven't gotten around to looking at whats possible with Jetbrains Plugins.
